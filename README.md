# MyPythonPractices
Here is what problems I solved to learn python : I hope I'll describe problem and solution.

**First problem** is an excercise from Codility.com that I used to resolve for an back-end developer interview.
The solution is provided both in c# and python languages.
PhotoPractice.py and PhotoPractice.cs.
input file is named photolist.txt

you can find full description for problem here :
